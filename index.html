      So far Ive mastered the basics of Python, including variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements. I have also done many projects with Python, including a glados chatbot using gemini, a discord bot (while borrowing some code), a virus that depends on what someone is typing in a live stream chat, and a matrix.org ai bot. Ive also contributed to a couple of my friends projects such as discord bots and more.

        Pineapple Bot is a discord bot that I created using discord.py. It has a variety of commands, including gemini ai that acts like glados, weather for certain locations, funfacts more. It was a addition to a friends projects and has been running on a pi 4. Click the image to add the bot to your server.

         I have a YouTube channel where I post occasionly of my projects and other things. I have a few videos up right now, including a video on the comparison of 3ds vs 2ds, and a few commentary videos. I use to have an old channel but over time it has been less and less valuable as my content diverged from the original audience.
